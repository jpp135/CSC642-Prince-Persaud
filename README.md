# CSC642-Prince-Persaud

The puprose of this CSC642 final project was to explore what population attributes - if any - indicate a county was likely to be a Covid 19 hotspot during the disease's early outbreak. This was done by analyzing demographic data preceding the outbreak (up to 2018 in most cases) and analyzing the infection rate within Florida counties up to May 2020 as cases ballooned in June 2020. 
If the results gained from this study are consistent, then it may be possible to identify which American population centers are most at risk in the event of future airborne pandemics.
Various machine leanring methods (support vector machines, decision trees, random forrests and logistic regressions) covered in CSC642 were employed in building models to predict which counties were Covid hotspots.
